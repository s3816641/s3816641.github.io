<h1 style="color:#282828;">My Profile</h1>

<p style="color:#282828;">
  My name is Mathew Hughes and I am currently 28 working full-time as an Implem
entation coordinator.
  My student number is s3816641 and my email address is s381664[at]student.rmit.edu.au
  I am Sydney born and raised, only speak English and my highest level of education today is advanced
  diploma in network security. I have also studied a diploma in Networking as well also at Tafe NSW.
  An interesting fun fact is that for the last 3-4 years I have played Laser tag at a national level
   competing in a few Australasia nationals titles. I have since taken a step back to focus on work
   and completing this course.</p>

<p style="color:#282828;">
I have always been interested in IT from around 15 when I was first exposed to a PC and the wide world web.
I donâ€™t think I have a defining person who sparked my interest it was more I could explore IT on my own and it grew from their.
  I started building my own PCs from around 16 and I studied a couple of It related classes in my later years
  of school
  In year 11 and 12 I studied Information Processes technology and Tech drawing mostly on auto cad but with some photoshop and illustrator as well.

<h2>Dream Job</h2>

<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39805656">Link to job here</a>

<p style="color:#282828;">My interpretation of this job is that the RBA is on the cutting edge of technology with lots of money being a bank and a need to be a technical fortress.</p>
<p style="color:#282828;">I believe this role is not about finding the direction to take the company as a whole but to internally consult from a IT security aspect to see if the all the projects are secure and technically feasible.</p>
